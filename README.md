# DAGA2025_MultiSourceLocalization
This repository hosts data and code of the DAS/DAGA 2025 paper 'Towards Models for Listener Envelopment based on Binaural Multi-Source Localization'.
The following figures illustrate the short-time probability maps generated by the model for two uncorrelated pink noise sources at $\pm 45$ degrees azimuth (block size of 10 milliseconds with 50% overlap).

The interaural time differences (ITDs) indicate the two targets over an illustrated time period of 200 milliseconds (40 blocks), whereas the interaural level differences (ILDs) suggest a widened but frontal auditory event. Lastly, the monaural spectral cues (SC) correctly indicate the two targets. 

The script *localization_model.py* calculates the probability maps, which is where the block size and frequency integration ranges for the cues can be set (and experimented with).
In *evaluateExperimentResultsAndModels.py*, the time-averaged probability maps are compared against the listening experiment data. Lastly, *visualizeProbabilityMaps.py* is the script that renders the ridgeline plots.
