# DAGA2025_MultiSourceLocalization
This repository hosts data and code of the DAS/DAGA 2025 paper 'Towards Models for Listener Envelopment based on Binaural Multi-Source Localization'.
The following figures illustrate the short-time probability maps generated by the model for two uncorrelated pink noise sources at $\pm 45$ degrees azimuth (block size of 10 milliseconds with 50% overlap).

The interaural time differences (ITDs) bounce between the two targets over an illustrated time period of 200 milliseconds (40 blocks). 
The interaural level differences (ILDs) indicate a widened but frontal auditory event. Lastly, the monaural spectral cues (SC) again indicate the two targets, when evaluated up to frequencies of 12 kHz.
