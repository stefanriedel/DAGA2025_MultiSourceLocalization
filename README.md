# DAGA2025_MultiSourceLocalization
This repository hosts data and code of the DAS/DAGA 2025 paper 'Towards Models for Listener Envelopment based on Binaural Multi-Source Localization'. <br/>
The script *localization_model.py* calculates the probability maps, which is where the block size and frequency integration ranges for the cues can be set (and experimented with).
In *evaluateExperimentResultsAndModels.py*, the time-averaged probability maps are compared against the listening experiment data. Lastly, *visualizeProbabilityMaps.py* is the script that renders the ridgeline plots. <br/>

The following figures illustrate short-time probability maps generated by the model for two uncorrelated pink-noise sources at +-45 degrees azimuth over a time period of 200 milliseconds (40 blocks, block size of 10 milliseconds with 50% overlap). Note that temporal integration across 100 to 200 milliseconds would combine the visualized short-term probability maps into one perceived 'auditory event':

The interaural time differences (ITDs) indicate the two targets, whereas the interaural level differences (ILDs) suggest a widened but frontal auditory event. Lastly, the monaural spectral cues (SC) correctly indicate the two targets. <br/>
For reference, here are the probability maps for a single pink-noise source at 45 degrees azimuth:

A diffuse scene with 13 active noise sources spanning -90 to 90 degrees azimuth results in a rather uniform distribution of events for the ITD and SC model, while the ILD model indicates again a widened, frontal auditory event.
